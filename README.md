Project made with <a href="https://github.com/tirannosario">Rosario Galioto</a> for "New Generation Data Models and DBMSs" course, Universit√† degli Studi di Milano, AA 2021/2022.

The project specification given by the professor is contained in <a href="project.md">project.md</a>, and it required the modeling and implementation of a NoSQL database for fraud detection.
